- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My initial impressions on how 'Inheritance' affects my programming is that it facilitates programming, eliminating the need to repeat the same thing in multiple files, allowing it to carry on. It allows for some difference, but the example of Mount Holyoke cards vs. Smith OneCards definitely solidified my views on it.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I was rather confused as to how super worked, but overall, inheritance made it slightly easier than previous assignments, as I now know I don't have to rewrite the same things, and can just identify similar attributes.
